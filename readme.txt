How to deploy code!

We used Visual Studio Code so code can be lauched using VS's live server option OR using python
in the command prompt and creating a server.

If using python:
1) Extract the folder to a folder that can easily be accessed/remembered
2) Open up command prompt
3) Navigate to where the folder is located
	ex: cd C:\Users\sukie\OneDrive\Desktop\Fall22\Info Vis\lab6
4) Type 'python -m http.server ####' with the #### being a 4-digit number you wish to use
5) Once that has loaded, go to your preferred browser and type: localhost:####
6) This should load the visualization!

If using VSC live server:
1) Extract the folder to a folder that can be easily accessed/remembered
2) Open Visual Studio Code and open the folder
3) Down at the bottom there should be an option called 'live server', click it
4) Visual Studio Code will then open your default browser with the visualization loaded.
